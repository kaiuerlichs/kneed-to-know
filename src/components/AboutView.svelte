                    Team Artists created that knee you were just looking at! They reconstructed a 3D model from CT-scan data of the skeleton and skin, built the ligaments and tendons and made it look pretty and snappy!

                This application was developed as part of the Virtual Anatomy Project 2022 at the University of Dundee. Its aim is for interdisciplinary development of digital tools in the field of anatomy and medicine, with an emphasis on augmented and virtual reality implementations. The main target of the Virtual Anatomy Project 2022 was web-based AR.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-2">
                Our application aims to facilitate peer and near-peer learning in medical and anatomical education. In particular, the application makes use of various Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to create an interactive environment in which medical students can learn about the examination of the knee joint in a fun and engaging manner.
